        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>When I was a beginner here is what I did. And by beginner I mean throughout my 4 years of college.

            I watched a lot of videos on YouTube talking about the different concepts of programming. I watched how algorithms work and how certain problems are solved. I still watch some videos on some days when I’m looking for a certain solution.
            I tried to take as many different CS classes as I could. This exposed me to different concepts and even different languages.
            I coded a lot. I used to put in a lot of effort in every single assignment. That helped me get used to the fact that coding in the beginning is trial and error. It takes a while before you get used to the small mistakes beginners make. The more you practice the better you get at eliminating common mistakes. In the beginning you might even feel like you’re too slow and you’re not solving the problem fast enough but trust me, it gets better. Don’t worry about the speed, worry about the accuracy. Is your code doing what it is supposed to do.
            I used to ask a lot of questions to the professor. Mostly after class when they had office hours.
            When I came across problems that I didn’t understand how to fix I would go to stack overflow. Now this one is a very slippery slope especially in college. You have to make sure you’re not plagiarising. Which is why I would always put the source in the comments of my code if I ever got information from stack overflow that helped me with any assignment. I never copied complete assignments from stack overflow. That’s a total no no. I only implemented code that fixed a certain problem that I was facing while coding an assignment. Like certain type of data structures are better suited at a certain task than others. That kind of stuff.
             Or a certain way of improving the efficiency of your code.</p>
